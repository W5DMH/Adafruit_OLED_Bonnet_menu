# Adafruit_OLED_Bonnet_menu
Just a feeble attempt at a menu system for the Adafruit 128x64 OLED bonnet 
The only file here that has been modified is the dansbuttons.py which is a work in progress as I try and make an on screen menu for the Adafruit 128x64 OLED bonnet. When the menu starts it is sleeping...you press up on the joystick to wake it up. 
Use at your own risk. 

03/06/18 added a splash at start up....
